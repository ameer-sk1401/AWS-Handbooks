## 4. Prompt Engineering

### What is Prompt Engineering?

**Definition**
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing text prompts to effectively communicate with and guide AI language models to produce desired outputs.

**Why Prompt Engineering Matters:**
- Foundation models are sensitive to input phrasing
- Small changes in prompts can dramatically affect outputs
- Proper prompting reduces need for fine-tuning
- Cost-effective way to improve model performance

**Components of Effective Prompts:**
- **Context**: Background information and setting
- **Instructions**: Clear, specific directions
- **Examples**: Demonstrations of desired format
- **Constraints**: Limitations and boundaries
- **Output Format**: Specification of desired response structure

### Prompt Engineering Techniques

**1. Zero-Shot Prompting**
Asking the model to perform a task without providing examples.

```
Example:
"Translate the following English text to French: 'Hello, how are you today?'"
```

**2. Few-Shot Prompting**
Providing a few examples to guide the model's understanding of the task.

```
Example:
"Translate English to French:
English: Hello → French: Bonjour
English: Thank you → French: Merci
English: Good morning → French: Bonjour
English: How are you? → French: ?"
```

**3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting**
Encouraging the model to break down complex problems into step-by-step reasoning.

```
Example:
"Let's solve this math problem step by step:
Problem: If a store has 45 apples and sells 18, then receives 30 more, how many apples does it have?

Step 1: Start with 45 apples
Step 2: Subtract 18 sold apples: 45 - 18 = 27
Step 3: Add 30 new apples: 27 + 30 = 57
Answer: 57 apples"
```

**4. Role-Based Prompting**
Assigning a specific role or persona to the model.

```
Example:
"You are a professional financial advisor. Explain the concept of compound interest to a 16-year-old who is just starting to learn about investing."
```

**5. Multi-Step Prompting**
Breaking complex tasks into multiple sequential prompts.

```
Example:
Step 1: "Analyze the provided data and identify key trends"
Step 2: "Based on the trends identified, what are the implications?"
Step 3: "Recommend three actionable steps based on your analysis"
```

### Prompt Performance Optimization

**Techniques for Better Performance:**

- Separate different sections of the prompt clearly
- Use XML-like tags for complex prompts

**4. Temperature and Parameter Tuning**
- Adjust temperature for creativity vs. consistency
- Modify top-p and top-k for output diversity
- Set appropriate max token limits

**5. Negative Prompting**
- Specify what you don't want in the output
- Add constraints to prevent unwanted behaviors
- Include safety and ethical guidelines

### Prompt Templates

Reusable prompt structures with variable placeholders that can be customized for different use cases while maintaining consistency.

**Template Structure:**
```
System Message: [Role definition and behavior guidelines]
Context: [Background information and setting]
